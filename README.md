# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-ML-Streamlit
Project Overview:
This project predicts whether a bank customer is likely to leave (churn) or stay using historical customer data. The dataset includes customer demographics (age, gender, geography), account information (balance, credit score, tenure, number of products), and activity indicators (active member, credit card ownership, estimated salary).

Objective:
The goal is to help banks identify customers at risk of leaving so they can take proactive actions to retain them.

Key Features Used:

Credit Score

Geography

Gender

Age

Tenure

Account Balance

Number of Products

Credit Card Ownership

Active Member Status

Estimated Salary

Models Used:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Gradient Boosting Classifier

Streamlit App:

User-friendly interface to input customer details

Predicts churn probability instantly

Displays clear and intuitive graphs for:

Age group vs churn

Balance vs churn

Geography vs churn

Gender vs churn

Visualization Highlights:

Stacked bar charts and histograms for easy interpretation

Color-coded charts (green = stayed, red = churned) for clarity

Why This Project is Important:
Customer retention is critical for banks to maintain revenue and reduce churn-related losses. This project provides a practical tool for banks to visualize churn patterns and predict risky customers using machine learning.

Tech Stack:

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn (ML Models)

Plotly (Interactive Charts)

Streamlit (Web App)
